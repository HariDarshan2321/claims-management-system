## 🏗️ 2. Component Architecture (The Departments Explained)

### 2.1 Intake Department (First Contact)
**What It Does**: Like a smart receptionist that never sleeps

**How It Helps WayTOO**:
- Customers can submit claims 24/7 through website or phone
- Automatically takes photos of defective parts
- Reads and understands complaint descriptions
- Spots duplicate complaints immediately
- Validates that the complaint makes sense

**Real Example**:
```
Customer uploads photo of bent wing bolt + description:
"Received 50 titanium bolts for aircraft assembly.
12 of them are bent and unusable. Order #WTO-2024-5678"

System automatically:
✅ Confirms order exists
✅ Analyzes photo - detects bent metal
✅ Checks if similar complaint already exists
✅ Assigns priority based on aircraft safety
✅ Creates case file in 30 seconds
```

**Technology Used** (For Technical Teams):
- **Programming**: Node.js with TypeScript (fast, reliable)
- **AI Vision**: OpenAI GPT-4V (can "see" defects in photos)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL + MongoDB (organized storage)
- **Security**: Enterprise-grade encryption

### 2.2 AI Detective Department (The Investigation Team)
**What It Does**: Like having Sherlock Holmes investigate every claim

**The AI Detective Team**:

1. **Triage Detective** 🕵️‍♀️
   - **Job**: "Is this claim legitimate and how urgent is it?"
   - **Process**: Analyzes photos, reads descriptions, checks customer history
   - **Output**: "High priority, legitimate claim, customer has good history"

2. **Root Cause Detective** 🔍
   - **Job**: "What actually went wrong and where?"
   - **Process**: Connects to production, warehouse, and shipping systems
   - **Output**: "Problem traced to Production Line 3, Batch B-1234, calibration issue on March 15th"

3. **Resolution Detective** 💡
   - **Job**: "What's the best way to fix this?"
   - **Process**: Considers cost, customer satisfaction, and company policy
   - **Output**: "Remake parts (cost: $1,200) better than refund ($3,000)"

4. **Escalation Detective** 🚨
   - **Job**: "Is this a bigger problem that needs executive attention?"
   - **Process**: Looks for patterns that could affect many customers
   - **Output**: "Alert: 15 similar claims this week - systemic production issue"

**Real Example Investigation**:
```
Claim: "Wrong size bolts - too small for aircraft assembly"

Triage Detective: "Legitimate claim, critical priority (aircraft safety)"
Root Cause Detective: "Batch B-1234 from Line 3 had calibration drift"
Resolution Detective: "Remake all parts from that batch, cost $15K vs $50K refund"
Escalation Detective: "Check all shipments from that batch - 47 customers affected"

Result: Proactive fix saves $200K in potential refunds
```

**Technology Used**:

## 🔄 3. Data Flow Architecture (How Information Moves)

### The Information Highway System

Think of this like a smart postal service that delivers messages instantly:

```
📬 INCOMING MAIL (Customer Complaints)
Customer submits claim → Message: "New claim arrived!"
    ↓
📮 SORTING OFFICE (AI Processing)
AI analyzes claim → Message: "Claim analyzed, root cause found!"
    ↓
📫 DECISION CENTER (Resolution)
System decides action → Message: "Approved for remake!"
    ↓
📪 EXECUTION (Taking Action)
Action performed → Message: "Customer notified, parts ordered!"
    ↓
📭 FILING (Record Keeping)
Case closed → Message: "Case completed, records updated!"
```

### Real-Time Event Examples

**Production Issue Detected**:
```
Production Line 3 → "Quality check failed on Batch B-1234"
    ↓
AI System → "Analyzing impact on shipped orders..."
    ↓
Risk Assessment → "47 customers may be affected"
    ↓
Proactive Action → "Contacting customers before they complain"
```

**Inventory Discrepancy**:
```
Warehouse → "We're missing 200 titanium bolts"
    ↓
AI System → "Cross-referencing recent claims..."
    ↓
Pattern Detection → "15 claims for missing bolts this week"
    ↓
Investigation → "Shipping error identified and fixed"
```

### Integration with WayTOO's Existing Systems

**How We Connect Without Disrupting Your Business**:

```
Your Production System ←→ Our AI System
"We made 1000 bolts     "Check if any claims
 in Batch B-1234"        relate to this batch"

Your Inventory System ←→ Our AI System
"We have 500 bolts      "Reserve 50 bolts for
 in Warehouse A"         remake order"

Your Shipping System ←→ Our AI System
"Order shipped via      "Track delivery for
 FedEx #123456"          claim resolution"

Your Quality System ←→ Our AI System
"Batch B-1234 failed    "Flag all related
 tensile strength test"  shipments for review"
```
