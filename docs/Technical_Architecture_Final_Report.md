<img width="3840" height="2213" alt="AI Agent Architecture _ Mermaid Chart-2025-07-13-060223" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6ef8a5bc-78be-4999-8eb9-15a642379463" />


### 2.2 Agent Specialization

**1. Triage Agent** üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
- **Purpose**: Determines claim legitimacy and urgency
- **AI Technology**: OpenAI GPT-4V for multimodal analysis
- **Process**: Analyzes photos, reads descriptions, checks customer history
- **Output**: "High priority, legitimate claim, customer has good history"

**2. Root Cause Agent** üîç
- **Purpose**: Identifies the source of the problem
- **Integration**: Real-time ERP data correlation
- **Process**: Connects to production, warehouse, and shipping systems
- **Output**: "Problem traced to Production Line 3, Batch B-1234, calibration issue on March 15th"

**3. Resolution Agent** üí°
- **Purpose**: Recommends optimal resolution strategy
- **Analysis**: Cost-benefit analysis, customer satisfaction impact
- **Process**: Considers cost, customer satisfaction, and company policy
- **Output**: "Remake parts (cost: $1,200) better than refund ($3,000)"

**4. Escalation Agent** üö®
- **Purpose**: Detects systemic issues requiring management attention
- **Pattern Recognition**: Identifies trends across multiple claims
- **Process**: Looks for patterns that could affect many customers
- **Output**: "Alert: 15 similar claims this week - systemic production issue"

**Real Example Investigation**:
```
Claim: "Wrong size bolts - too small for aircraft assembly"

Triage Agent: "Legitimate claim, critical priority (aircraft safety)"
Root Cause Agent: "Batch B-1234 from Line 3 had calibration drift"
Resolution Agent: "Remake all parts from that batch, cost $15K vs $50K refund"
Escalation Agent: "Check all shipments from that batch - 47 customers affected"

Result: Proactive fix saves $200K in potential refunds
```

## üìä 3. BPMN Workflow Process

### 3.1 Business Process Model

Our workflow engine follows BPMN 2.0 standards, enabling visual process design with intuitive configuration:

<img width="1769" height="3840" alt="BPMN Workflow Process _ Mermaid Chart-2025-07-13-060438" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/08f7cd61-e432-4b3e-b05e-d8c33301b591" />


### 3.2 Decision Logic Explained

**Auto-Approval Criteria** (ALL must be met):
- ‚úÖ AI Confidence > 90%
- ‚úÖ Claim Value < $1,000
- ‚úÖ No fraud risk detected
- ‚úÖ Standard claim category

**Why Claims Go to "Pending Approval"**:
1. **Financial Control**: High-value claims (>$1000) require human approval
2. **AI Confidence**: Only high-confidence AI decisions are auto-approved
3. **Risk Management**: Complex cases need human judgment
4. **Compliance**: Audit trails require oversight for significant claims
5. **Business Logic**: Conservative approach prevents invalid approvals

**Escalation Triggers**:
- High-value claims (>$50,000)
- Systemic issues detected
- Repeated customer complaints
- Quality control failures
