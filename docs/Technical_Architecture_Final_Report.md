![AI Agent Architecture](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7a8b9c0d-1e2f-3g4h-5i6j-7k8l9m0n1o2p)

### 2.2 Agent Specialization

**1. Triage Agent** üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
- **Purpose**: Determines claim legitimacy and urgency
- **AI Technology**: OpenAI GPT-4V for multimodal analysis
- **Process**: Analyzes photos, reads descriptions, checks customer history
- **Output**: "High priority, legitimate claim, customer has good history"

**2. Root Cause Agent** üîç
- **Purpose**: Identifies the source of the problem
- **Integration**: Real-time ERP data correlation
- **Process**: Connects to production, warehouse, and shipping systems
- **Output**: "Problem traced to Production Line 3, Batch B-1234, calibration issue on March 15th"

**3. Resolution Agent** üí°
- **Purpose**: Recommends optimal resolution strategy
- **Analysis**: Cost-benefit analysis, customer satisfaction impact
- **Process**: Considers cost, customer satisfaction, and company policy
- **Output**: "Remake parts (cost: $1,200) better than refund ($3,000)"

**4. Escalation Agent** üö®
- **Purpose**: Detects systemic issues requiring management attention
- **Pattern Recognition**: Identifies trends across multiple claims
- **Process**: Looks for patterns that could affect many customers
- **Output**: "Alert: 15 similar claims this week - systemic production issue"

**Real Example Investigation**:
```
Claim: "Wrong size bolts - too small for aircraft assembly"

Triage Agent: "Legitimate claim, critical priority (aircraft safety)"
Root Cause Agent: "Batch B-1234 from Line 3 had calibration drift"
Resolution Agent: "Remake all parts from that batch, cost $15K vs $50K refund"
Escalation Agent: "Check all shipments from that batch - 47 customers affected"

Result: Proactive fix saves $200K in potential refunds
```

## üìä 3. BPMN Workflow Process

### 3.1 Business Process Model

Our workflow engine follows BPMN 2.0 standards, enabling visual process design like Agent-F's no-code approach:

![BPMN Workflow Process](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2b3c4d5e-6f7g-8h9i-0j1k-2l3m4n5o6p7q)

### 3.2 Decision Logic Explained

**Auto-Approval Criteria** (ALL must be met):
- ‚úÖ AI Confidence > 90%
- ‚úÖ Claim Value < $1,000
- ‚úÖ No fraud risk detected
- ‚úÖ Standard claim category

**Why Claims Go to "Pending Approval"**:
1. **Financial Control**: High-value claims (>$1000) require human approval
2. **AI Confidence**: Only high-confidence AI decisions are auto-approved
3. **Risk Management**: Complex cases need human judgment
4. **Compliance**: Audit trails require oversight for significant claims
5. **Business Logic**: Conservative approach prevents invalid approvals

**Escalation Triggers**:
- High-value claims (>$50,000)
- Systemic issues detected
- Repeated customer complaints
- Quality control failures

![Data Flow Architecture](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3c4d5e6f-7g8h-9i0j-1k2l-3m4n5o6p7q8r)

### 4.2 Event Streaming Details

**Step-by-Step Process**:

1. **Customer Submission**: Customer submits claim with photos through web portal
2. **Claim Intake**: System validates and stores claim data, publishes `claim.submitted` event
3. **AI Processing**: Multi-agent analysis processes claim, queries ERP systems
4. **Decision Routing**: Workflow engine determines approval path based on value and confidence
5. **Financial Check**: Financial controls assess risk and cash flow impact
6. **Resolution Execution**: Approved claims trigger automatic resolution processes
7. **Customer Notification**: Real-time updates sent to customer
8. **Audit Trail**: All actions recorded in immutable blockchain ledger

**Kafka Event Topics**:
- `claim.submitted` - New claim intake
- `claim.analyzed` - AI processing complete
- `claim.routed` - Decision routing
- `claim.resolved` - Final resolution
- `production.issue` - ERP system alerts
