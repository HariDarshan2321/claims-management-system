# Video Walkthrough Script - WayTOO Claims Management System

## üé¨ Video Structure (‚â§3 minutes)

### Introduction (30 seconds)
"Hello! I'm excited to present my solution for Agent-F's Claims Management System challenge. I've designed a comprehensive AI-powered platform for WayTOO Manufacturing that transforms how they handle customer claims for missing or mis-sized parts."

### Architecture Overview (45 seconds)
"Let me walk you through the system architecture. At its core, we have a microservices-based design with four key components:

1. **Claim Intake Service** - Handles multi-modal AI analysis of incoming claims
2. **AI Agents Service** - Orchestrates intelligent processing with specialized agents
3. **Workflow Engine** - Manages BPMN-compliant business processes
4. **Financial Controls** - Ensures real-time cash flow monitoring and audit trails

The system integrates seamlessly with existing ERP modules through event-driven architecture using Apache Kafka."

### Key Design Decisions (60 seconds)
"I made several critical design decisions to balance automation, UX, and financial control:

**AI-First Approach**: Multi-agent system with specialized roles - Triage, Analysis, Resolution, and Escalation agents work in parallel to process claims intelligently.

**Event-Driven Architecture**: Ensures loose coupling and scalability. Each claim triggers a series of events that flow through the system asynchronously.

**Human-in-the-Loop**: While 80% of claims are automated, complex cases route to human reviewers with AI recommendations and confidence scores.

**Financial Safeguards**: Real-time cash flow impact calculation, blockchain audit trails, and automated fraud detection protect against unwarranted refunds.

**ERP Integration**: Deep integration with Production, Inventory, Logistics, and QC modules enables accurate root-cause analysis."

### Live Demo (30 seconds)
"Let me show you the system in action. Here's our web interface where customers submit claims. Watch as the AI processes this high-value aerospace claim in real-time - triage analysis, root cause detection, and resolution recommendation all happen automatically. The system detected this as a systemic issue and escalated to operations while calculating the financial impact."

### Why Agent-F (15 seconds)
"I'm excited about Agent-F because you're building the future of AI-powered enterprise solutions. This challenge perfectly aligns with my passion for creating intelligent systems that solve real business problems while maintaining human oversight and financial integrity."
