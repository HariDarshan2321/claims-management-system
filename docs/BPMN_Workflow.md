## Detailed Process Steps

### 1. Claim Intake Phase

**Start Event**: Customer submits claim via web portal, API, or email

**Activities**:
- Validate required fields
- Generate unique claim ID
- Set initial priority based on value
- Calculate SLA deadline
- Create audit trail entry

**Business Rules**:
- All mandatory fields must be completed
- Estimated value must be > $0
- Customer ID must exist in system

### 2. AI Triage Phase

**Parallel Gateway**: Multiple AI agents process simultaneously

**Triage Agent Activities**:
- Classify claim category
- Assign priority level
- Extract key information
- Generate confidence score

**Duplicate Check**:
- Compare against existing claims
- Use ML similarity matching
- Flag potential duplicates
- Route duplicates for manual review

**Image Analysis** (if images provided):
- Detect visual defects
- Measure dimensions
- Identify part numbers
- Generate annotations

**Text Analysis**:
- Sentiment analysis
- Keyword extraction
- Urgency detection
- Language processing

**Risk Assessment**:
- Fraud risk calculation
- Financial impact analysis
- Reputation risk evaluation
- Compliance check

### 3. Root Cause Analysis Phase

**ERP Integration**:
- Query production data
- Check inventory records
- Review logistics information
- Analyze QC reports

**AI Correlation**:
- Match claim to production batch
- Identify potential causes
- Calculate confidence levels
- Detect systemic issues

### 4. Decision Gateway Phase

**Escalation Decision**:
- Systemic issue detected → Escalate to Operations
- High value claim → Escalate to Management
- Critical priority → Escalate to Customer Success
- Standard processing → Continue to resolution

**Auto-Approval Decision**:
- Low value + High confidence → Auto-approve
- Standard cases → Route to manager
- Complex cases → Manual review

### 5. Resolution Execution Phase

**Resolution Types**:
- **Remake**: Schedule production of replacement parts
- **Refund**: Process payment reversal
- **Replacement**: Ship alternative product
- **Partial Credit**: Apply account credit

**Execution Activities**:
- Update inventory systems
- Process financial transactions
- Schedule logistics
- Generate documentation

### 6. Notification and Closure Phase

**Customer Notification**:
- Send resolution confirmation
- Provide tracking information
- Update customer portal
- Schedule follow-up

**System Updates**:
- Update claim status
- Record resolution details
- Update SLA metrics
- Create final audit entry

## Subprocess: Escalation Workflow

```
[Escalation Triggered]
    ↓
[Determine Escalation Type]
    ↓
(Exclusive Gateway)
    ↓ Operations        ↓ Management       ↓ Customer Success
[Notify Operations] [Notify Management] [Notify CS Team]
    ↓                   ↓                  ↓
[Create Task]      [Schedule Review]   [Priority Handling]
    ↓                   ↓                  ↓
[Assign Owner]     [Management Decision] [Direct Resolution]
    ↓                   ↓                  ↓
[Track Progress] → [Return to Main Flow] ← [Expedite Process]
    ↓
[Resolution Complete]
    ↓
[End Subprocess]
```

## Subprocess: Financial Controls

```
[Resolution Approved]
    ↓
[Calculate Financial Impact]
    ↓
[Check Budget Limits]
    ↓
(Exclusive Gateway: Exceeds Limit?)
    ↓ Yes                    ↓ No
[Require CFO Approval] → [Process Transaction]
    ↓                        ↓
[CFO Decision]          [Update Accounting]
    ↓                        ↓
[Approve/Reject] → [Record in Blockchain]
    ↓                        ↓
[Process if Approved] → [Generate Reports]
    ↓                        ↓
[End Subprocess] ← ← ← [End Subprocess]
```

## SLA Management

### SLA Definitions

| Priority | Initial Response | Resolution Target | Escalation Trigger |
|----------|------------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Critical | 1 hour | 24 hours | 12 hours |
| High | 4 hours | 48 hours | 24 hours |
| Medium | 8 hours | 72 hours | 48 hours |
| Low | 24 hours | 120 hours | 96 hours |

### SLA Monitoring

**Timer Events**:
- SLA warning at 75% of deadline
- SLA breach notification at 100% of deadline
- Automatic escalation at 125% of deadline

**Metrics Tracked**:
- Time to first response
- Time to resolution
- SLA compliance rate
- Escalation frequency

## Error Handling

### Exception Scenarios

1. **System Unavailable**
   - Queue claim for processing
   - Send acknowledgment to customer
   - Retry with exponential backoff

2. **ERP Integration Failure**
   - Use cached data if available
   - Flag for manual review
   - Continue with limited analysis

3. **AI Service Timeout**
   - Route to human review
   - Log incident for analysis
   - Apply default business rules

4. **Payment Processing Error**
   - Retry transaction
   - Notify finance team
   - Create manual task

### Compensation Activities

- Rollback partial transactions
- Send error notifications
- Create incident tickets
- Update audit trails

## Performance Optimization

### Parallel Processing
- AI agents run concurrently
- ERP queries executed in parallel
- Notifications sent asynchronously

### Caching Strategy
- Cache ERP data for 15 minutes
- Store AI model results
- Cache customer information

### Load Balancing
- Distribute claims across agents
- Balance ERP query load
- Scale based on volume

## Compliance and Audit

### Audit Trail Requirements
- Every process step logged
- User actions recorded
- System decisions documented
- Timestamps with timezone

### Compliance Checkpoints
- GDPR data handling verification
- SOX financial controls validation
- Industry-specific requirements
- Data retention policy enforcement

## Integration Points

### ERP Systems
- Production Management
- Inventory Control
- Quality Assurance
- Logistics Tracking

### External Services
- Payment Processors
- Shipping Carriers
- Customer Communication
- Regulatory Reporting

### Monitoring Systems
- Application Performance
- Business Metrics
- Error Tracking
- Security Events

This BPMN workflow ensures efficient, compliant, and auditable claim processing while maintaining the flexibility to handle various claim types and business scenarios.
