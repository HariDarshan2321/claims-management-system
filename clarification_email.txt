Subject: Clarification on AI Integration Scope - Claims Management System Challenge

To: Felix Schl√§ger <Felix@agent-f.com>

Dear Felix,

I hope this email finds you well. Thank you for the opportunity to work on this exciting Claims Management System engineering challenge - it's been a fantastic experience diving into AI-driven ERP architecture.

I'm currently finalizing my solution and want to ensure I deliver exactly what Agent-F is looking for.

I have a quick clarification question regarding the scope of AI integration expected in the solution:

Question: When the challenge asks to "Design, at an architectural level, a Claims Management System" with "AI-driven multi-agent system," what level of AI implementation are you expecting?

Option A: Architectural design with:
- System diagrams showing AI agent components
- Technology stack choices (e.g., OpenAI GPT-4V, LangChain)
- Data flows and integration patterns
- Simulated AI logic demonstrating the concepts

Option B: Functional prototype with:
- Working AI API integrations (OpenAI, etc.)
- Real AI models processing actual data
- Live API key configuration and service calls

I've prepared a comprehensive architectural solution with working prototypes, but I want to ensure the AI integration depth matches your expectations before finalizing my submission.

Context: I have the complete technical architecture, BPMN workflows, component diagrams, and a functional demo ready. I just want to confirm whether you'd like to see actual AI service integration or if the architectural design with simulated AI logic is sufficient for this challenge.

Thank you again for this opportunity and for your time in providing guidance.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
